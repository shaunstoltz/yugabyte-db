YugabyteDB comes bundled with a number of [PostgreSQL extensions](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#pre-bundled-extensions) that are tested to work with YSQL. We're incrementally developing support for as many extensions as possible. (Since YugabyteDBâ€™s underlying storage architecture is not the same as PostgreSQL, many PostgreSQL extensions, particularly those that interact with the storage layer, won't work as-is on YugabyteDB.)

## Pre-bundled extensions

The following extensions are bundled with YugabyteDB. Click an extension's name for more detailed documentation and example code.

* [**fuzzystrmatch**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#fuzzystrmatch) provides functions to determine similarities and distance between strings.

<!--
* [orafce](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#orafce) provides compatibility with Oracle functions and packages that are either missing or implemented differently in YugabyteDB and PostgreSQL. This compatibility layer can help you port your Oracle applications to YugabyteDB.
-->

* [**pg_stat_statements**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#pg-stat-statements) lets you track execution statistics for all SQL statements executed by a server.

* [**pgAudit**](/latest/secure/audit-logging/audit-logging-ysql/) allows you to collect detailed session and object audit logging via YugabyteDB TServer logging. Audit logs are often required as part of government, financial, or other certifications, such as ISO.

* [**pgcrypto**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#pgcrypto) provides cryptographic functions, including hashing, encryption, and decryption functions.

* [**SPI**, the server programming interface](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#server-programming-interface-spi-module) module, allows you to create functions and stored procedures in C.

## Other verified extensions

The following extensions are verified to work with YugabyteDB, but aren't pre-bundled. Click an extension's name for detailed installation and usage documentation.

* [**PostGIS**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#postgis) is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL-compatible object-relational databases. (Note that YugabyteDB does not currently support GiST indexes.)
* [**postgresql-hll**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#postgresql-hll-postgresql-extension-for-hyperloglog) provides support for HyperLogLog, a fixed-size, set-like structure used for distinct value counting with tunable precision.
* [**uuid-ossp**](/latest/api/ysql/extensions/#uuid-ossp) provides functions to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), and functions to produce certain special UUID constants.
