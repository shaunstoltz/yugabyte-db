This document describes how to create, use, and manage views in YSQL.

## Overview

Views allow you to present data in YugabyteDB tables by using a different variety of named queries. In essence, a view is a proxy for a complex query to which you assign a name. In YSQL, views do not store data. 

## Creating Views

You create views based on the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS query_definition;
```

*query_definition* can be a simple `SELECT` statement or a `SELECT` statement with joins.

Suppose you work with a database that includes the following table populated with data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  address text,
  department text
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO employees VALUES 
  (1221, 'John Smith', '1 Main Street', 'Marketing'),
  (1222, 'Bette Davis', '2 Second Avenue', 'Sales'),
  (1223, 'Lucille Ball', '3 Third Avenue', 'Operations'),
  (1224, 'John Zimmerman', '4 Fourth Avenue', 'Sales'); 
```

The following very simplified example creates a view based on only one table and selects two of its columns:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employees_view AS 
  SELECT employee_no, name FROM employees;
```

The following example shows how to query `employees_view`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees_view;
```

The preceding query produces the following output:

```
employee_no | name
------------+---------------------------
1223        | Lucille Ball
1224        | John Zimmerman
1221        | John Smith
1222        | Bette Davis
```

If you create a view based on multiple tables with joins, using this view in your queries would significantly simplify the process. 

## Modifying Views

You can modify the query based on which a view was created by combining the `CREATE VIEW` statement with `OR REPLACE`, as demonstrated by the following syntax:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS query_definition;
```

YSQL does not allow you to remove existing columns from the view (your query has to produce the same columns that were produced when you created the view), but it allows you to append more columns, as shown in the following example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employees_view AS 
  SELECT employee_no, name, department FROM employees;
```

The following example shows how to query `employees_view` to verify that the `department` column was appended to the end of the columns list:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees_view;
```

The preceding query produces the following output:

```
 employee_no | name             | department
-------------+------------------+----------------
 1223        | Lucille Ball     | Operations
 1224        | John Zimmerman   | Sales
 1221        | John Smith       | Marketing
 1222        | Bette Davis      | Sales
```

## Deleting Views

You can remove (drop) an existing view by using the `DROP VIEW` statement, as demonstrated by the following syntax:

```
DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] view_name;
```

It is recommended to add the `IF EXISTS` option to the `DROP VIEW` statement: if you omit this option and attempt to drop the view, an error will occur.

The following example shows how to remove a view from the database:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS employees_view;
```

You can also remove more than one view by providing a comma-separated list of view names.

## Using Updatable Views

Some of YSQL views are updatable. The defining query of such views (1) must have only one entry (either a table or another updatable view) in its `FROM` clause, (2) cannot contain `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`, or `LIMIT` clauses at the top level. In addition, the view's selection list cannot contain  window functions, set-returning or aggregate functions.

The following example shows how to update the `employees` table with a new row via the `employees_view` defined in [Creating Views](#creating-views):

```sql
INSERT INTO employees_view (employee_no, name)
  VALUES (1227, 'Lee Bo');
```

If you select everything from the `employees` table by executing `SELECT * FROM employees;` , you should expect the following output:

```
 employee_no | name             | address        | department
-------------+------------------+----------------+--------------
 1227        | Lee Bo           |                |
 1223        | Lucille Ball     | 3 Third Avenue | Operations
 1224        | John Zimmerman   | 4 Fourth Avenue| Sales
 1221        | John Smith       | 1 Main Street  | Marketing
 1222        | Bette Davis      | 2 Second Avenue| Sales
```

Executing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on an updatable view converts that statement into the corresponding statement of the base table.

If the defining query of a view contains a `WHERE` clause, you are allowed to modify the rows that are not visible via the view.

An updatable view can contain a combination of updatable and non-updatable columns. An attempt to update the latter results in an error.

To be able to update a view, you need to have the required privilege on this view (but not necessarily on the base table).

The following example shows how use the the `employees_view` to delete the row that has been added to the  `employees` table:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees_view
  WHERE employee_no = 1227;
```
