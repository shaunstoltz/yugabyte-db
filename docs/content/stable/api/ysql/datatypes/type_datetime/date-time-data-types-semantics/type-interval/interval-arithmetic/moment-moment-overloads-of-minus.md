The function _moment_moment_subtraction()_ models the algorithm for this operation for a pair of _timestamp_ values. Create it thus:

```plpgsql
drop function if exists moment_moment_subtraction(timestamptz, timestamptz) cascade;

create function moment_moment_subtraction(t1 timestamptz, t2 timestamptz)
  returns interval
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  s1       constant double precision not null := extract(epoch from t1);
  s2       constant double precision not null := extract(epoch from t2);
  i_model  constant interval         not null := justify_hours(make_interval(secs=>(s1 - s2)));

  i_actual constant interval         not null := t1 - t2;
begin
  assert i_model = i_actual, 'assert failed';
  return i_model;
end;
$body$;
```

The _extract(epoch&nbsp;from...)_ function, for a _timestamp_ argument, determines the number of seconds from the so-called start of the epoch, _'1970-01-01 00:00:00'_, to the specified moment. For a _timestamptz_ argument, the epoch simply starts, as you'd expect, at _'1970-01-01 00:00:00 -00'_. And for a _time_ argument, the epoch starts at midnight.

The semantics of the _justify_hours()_ function is explained in the section [Comparing two interval values for equality](../interval-interval-equality/). This semantics is dubious for the case of creating an _interval_ value by subtracting one _timestamptz_ value from another because you are very likely to produce a hybrid _interval_ value.

Notice that the _moment_moment_subtraction()_ function uses an _assert_ statement to check that the result of the modeled implementation agrees with that of the actual implementation. Test it like this:

```plpgsql
set timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';
select moment_moment_subtraction(
  '2021-03-14 20:00:00'::timestamptz,'2021-03-13 18:00:00'::timestamptz);
```

This is the result:

```output
1 day 01:00:00
```

Notice that it's hybrid: it has both a _days_ component and a _seconds_ component. Now add this _interval_ value to the _timestamptz_ value that subtracted:

```plpgsql
select '2021-03-13 18:00:00'::timestamptz + '1 day 01:00:00'::interval;
```

This is the result:

```output
2021-03-14 19:00:00-07
```

You don't get back the _timestamptz_ value that you started with.

The critical feature of this example that least to what seems to be a wrong result is that 18:00 on 13-Mar-2021 in the 'America/Los_Angeles' timezone is before the "spring forward" moment when Daylight Savings Time starts, and that 20:00 and 19:00 on 14-Mar-2021 in that timezone are both after the "spring forward" moment.

It's possible to understand, and predict, this outcome (and other hybrid _interval_ arithmetic outcomes like it) by understanding the three different kinds of semantics for the moment-_interval_ overloads of the `+` and `-` operators for pure _mm_ _interval_ values, pure _dd_ _interval_ values, and pure _ss_ _interval_ values. But when you have a hybrid _dd_ and _mm_ _interval_ value, you need also to understand the priority rule: in which order are the different variations of addition/subtraction semantics done?

{{< tip title="Avoid arithmetic that uses hybrid interval semantics." >}}
Yugabyte staff members have discussed this carefully and believe that the attempt to understand and memorize these rules is counterproductiveâ€”and therefore foolish. Rather, you should decide which of the three kinds of semantics your application needs and arrange that you produce only pure, rather than hybrid, _interval_ values. It recommends, therefore, that  you adopt the practice that the section [Defining and using custom domain types to specialize the native _interval_ functionality](../../custom-interval-domains/) explains.
