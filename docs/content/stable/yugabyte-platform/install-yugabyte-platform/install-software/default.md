YugabyteDB universes and clusters are created and managed using Yugabyte Platform. The default option to install Yugabyte Platform on a host machine that is connected to the Internet.

## Install Replicated

Connect to a Yugabyte Platform instance and then install Replicated by executing the following command:

```sh
$ curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash
```

If you are installing Replicated behind a proxy, you need to execute the following command:

```sh
$ curl -x http://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port> https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash
```

After the Replicated installation completes, verify that it is running by executing the following command:

```sh
$ sudo docker ps
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

![Replicated successfully installed](/images/replicated/replicated-success.png)

## Set Up HTTPS (optional)

Launch the Replicated UI via [http://yugaware-host-public-ip:8800](http://yugaware-host-public-ip:8800). Expect to see a warning stating that the connection to the server is not yet private. This condition is resolved once HTTPS for the Replicated Admin Console is set up in the next step. Proceed by clicking **Continue to Setup** **>** **ADVANCED** to bypass the warning and access the **Replicated Admin Console**, as shown in the following illustration:

![Replicated SSL warning](/images/replicated/replicated-warning.png)

You can provide your own custom SSL certificate and a hostname, as shown in the following illustration:

![Replicated HTTPS setup](/images/replicated/replicated-https.png)

It is recommended that you start with using a self-signed certificate, and then add the custom SSL certificate later. Note that in this case you connect to the Replicated Admin Console using an IP address, as shown in the following illustration:

## Upload the License File

Upload the Yugabyte license file that you received from [Yugabyte](https://www.yugabyte.com/platform/#request-trial-form), as shown in the following illustration:

![Replicated License Upload](/images/replicated/replicated-license-upload.png)

If you are prompted to choose an installation type, choose **Online**, as shown in the following illustration:

## Secure Replicated

Add a password to protect the Replicated Admin Console, which is different from the Admin Console for YugabyteDB used by Yugabyte Platform, as shown in the following illustration:

![Replicated Password](/images/replicated/replicated-password.png)

## Preflight Checks

Replicated performs a set of preflight checks to ensure that the host is set up correctly for Yugabyte Platform, as shown in the following illustration:

![Replicated Checks](/images/replicated/replicated-checks.png)

Click **Continue** to configure Yugabyte Platform.

If the preflight check fails, review the [Troubleshoot Yugabyte Platform](../../../troubleshoot/) to resolve the issue.

## Set the TLS Version for Nginx Frontend 

Specify TLS versions via **Application config**, as shown in the following illustration: 

![Application Config](/images/replicated/application-config.png)

The recommended TLS version is 1.2.
